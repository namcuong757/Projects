Add functionality to itemmanager.cpp so that you can click on the labels for quantity and cents.
When clicking on them, they switch between text that reads "Quantity" and "Quantity (at least)" and "Quantity (at most)" and all the same for cents.
Then when you type in the LineEdits next to them, the results are filtered so that the tableview shows records with that exact qty/price, at least that qty/price, or at most that qty/price.
